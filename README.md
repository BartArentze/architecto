# Project [Architecto](!http://architecto.bartarentze.nl)

I designed this project from scratch and then converted it into an website. I made the design with Adobe XD. During development I used a Bootstrap 5 template that compiled scss files into one large css file.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with `dist` directory. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

Clone the source files of the theme and navigate into the theme's root directory. Run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `package.json` file to see which scripts are included.
